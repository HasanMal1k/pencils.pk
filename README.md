# Pencils Website

This project was originally intended to be a website for a pencil business. However, due to the lack of suitable 3D pencil models, the original idea was eventually shelved.

That said, I decided to complete the site anyway to explore and experiment with **3D rendering in React** using:

*  **React Three Fiber**
*  **@react-three/drei**
*  **Framer Motion** for animated text

The scene features several floating pencils, with one that responds interactively to the user's mouse movement. This was a fun project focused on learning and experimenting with 3D visuals and user interaction in a React environment.
